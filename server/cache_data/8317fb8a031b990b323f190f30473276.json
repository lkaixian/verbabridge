  "slang_detected": "6 7 (Luk Chat)",
  "literal_translation": "A Cantonese numeric pun where '6' (luk) and '7' (chat) phonetically mimic vulgar terms for male genitalia. It is used as an insult to call someone an idiot, a loser, or to describe a situation that is completely messed up or 'cock-up'.",
  "analogies": [
    "It's like when you're at the Mamak and your friend accidentally pours the whole bottle of kicap into his Maggi Goreng—he's being a total '6 7'. It's the Cantonese upgrade to calling someone a 'blur sotong' but with 100% more 'lanchiau' energy.",
    "Think of it as the Malaysian Gen Z version of the 'Clown' emoji or saying someone has 'Zero IQ'. If a TikToker tries to do a 'prank' that just makes them look like a public nuisance, the comment section would just be '6 7' to indicate they are a total tool."
  ],
  "ambiguity_warning": "Highly context-dependent. In a math context or when ordering '67' at a economy rice stall, it is just a number. In any social, gaming, or heated argument context, it is a vulgar insult. Use with caution around Cantonese-speaking elders."
