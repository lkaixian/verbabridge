  "slang_detected": "6 7",
  "literal_translation": "A numeric euphemism for the Hokkien profanity 'Lan-Tshat,' meaning a situation is completely messed up, disorganized, or 'cocked up.' It describes total chaos or someone acting like a fool.",
  "analogies": [
    "It is like going to the Jelutong market at 9 AM on a Sunday and finding out the main road is closed for paving—total 'lak-tshat' (6 7) chaos where nobody knows where to go and everyone is honking.",
    "Think of it like a P. Ramlee comedy where the characters are trying to hide a secret but everything goes wrong at once; it's that moment when the plan falls apart and becomes a complete 'messy-mess'."
  ],
  "ambiguity_warning": "Literally, it is just the numbers six and seven. However, in the context of Malaysian and Singaporean internet slang, it is used specifically to bypass censors when calling something 'Lan-Tshat' (shambolic/dick-like mess)."
