  "slang_detected": "capping",
  "literal_translation": "To lie, exaggerate, or provide false information. Often used to call someone out for being dishonest or 'faking it.'",
  "analogies": [
    "It is the modern equivalent of 'telling a tall tale' or 'spinning a yarn.' Just as you might have told someone they were 'full of hot air' or 'jiving' back in the day, a young person today would simply say you are 'capping.'",
    "Think of it like a fisherman boasting about a catch that was actually half the size he claims. In the 1960s or 70s, you'd say he's 'pulling your leg' or 'talking bunkum'; today, the youth would say he's 'capping' and might show you a blue baseball cap emoji to signify the lie."

  "ambiguity_warning": "In Standard English, 'capping' refers to placing a lid on a container, setting a limit on a budget (a 'price cap'), or a dental restoration. In internet slang, it is strictly about dishonesty and has no relation to physical headwear or financial limits."
