  "analogies": [
    "It's like that one fellow at the Cecil Street Market who tries to park his bike right in the middle of the walkway and then gives you an attitude when you ask him to move; he is being '6 7'. In Penang Hokkien terms, it's the modern digital version of calling someone a 'lan-pau' or 'si-bin-kia'.",
    "Think of it like the 1960s P. Ramlee era 'bengong' or 'bodoh' characters, but with a hidden vulgarity. It's like using a secret radio code to swear at someone without the 'Mata' (police) or your grandmother knowing exactly what you said."
  ],
  "ambiguity_warning": "Literally, these are just the numbers six and seven. However, in the context of Malaysian/Singaporean social media comments or gaming, it is almost exclusively used as a phonetic substitute for Cantonese swear words (陸七) to avoid being banned or censored."
