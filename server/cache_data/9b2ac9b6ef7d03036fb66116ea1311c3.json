  "analogies": [
    "It is the digital equivalent of a 1970s novelty song like 'Disco Duck'—a bizarre, catchy trend that children find hilarious but leaves adults wondering where society went wrong.",
    "Think of it as the 'Kilroy was here' of the 2020s; it is a repetitive visual gag that has become a universal shorthand for a specific generation's humor, much like how 'The Three Stooges' used slapstick and strange sounds to entertain audiences in a different era."

  "ambiguity_warning": "While the word 'Skibidi' originates from a Turkish song's scat-singing lyrics ('Biser King'), it no longer carries a musical meaning.
