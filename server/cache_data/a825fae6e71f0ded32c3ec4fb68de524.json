  "slang_detected": "Cap",
  "literal_translation": "To lie, exaggerate, or provide false information. Often used as 'No cap' to emphasize that one is being completely honest or 'Stop capping' to tell someone to stop lying.",
  "analogies": [
    "It's the modern Manglish equivalent of 'Kencing' or 'Sembang kencang'. Like that one friend who says he's 'on the way' to the mamak but actually just stepped into the shower—that's pure cap.",
    "The digital version of Pinocchio's nose growing. If a YouTuber puts a red circle on a thumbnail where nothing is happening, that's 'Clickbait Cap' for the views."
  ],
  "ambiguity_warning": "In a literal context, it refers to headgear (a hat) or a bottle lid. In Gen Z slang, it exclusively refers to the act of lying. Context is usually obvious: if someone says 'You capping', they aren't talking about your fashion choices."
