  "analogies": [
    "It’s like that panic you feel at the Cecil Street Market when you’re double-parked to buy Apom and someone yells 'Mata lai liao!'—it's the ultimate signal to 'cabut' (run) before you get a 'saman' (fine).",
    "In the Gen Z multiverse, it’s the real-life equivalent of the 'FBI Open Up' meme or seeing a 'Sus' player in Among Us who actually has the power to ban you from the server."
  ],
  "ambiguity_warning": "Highly ambiguous context. In a medical or literal sense, it refers to the organ of sight (eye). However, in the streets of Penang or in a 'rempit' subculture context, it exclusively refers to the police. Using it incorrectly could make you sound like you're having a medical emergency when you're actually trying to warn your 'kaki' about a roadblock."
